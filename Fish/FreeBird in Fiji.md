# FreeBird in Fiji
Hi, everybody. In this blog I just wanna record my interesting things, share my thoughts in life and learning spoken English experience.

By the way, my English is suck, I don't have enough vocabulary, good grammer and **logical capability**, so, It's possible this blog is mess and doesn't have good points you worth reading, think it over before starting, lol. Maybe with the process of my studying, it will be more and more better, I hope so~

OK, let's start!

## Why did I choose and come here?

Do you know? I have graduated from college about 3 years. Yeah, so fast and quietly, right? My major is Packaging Engineering that is a long story why I choosed and studied during my **undergraduate** year. I don't like the major at all. Emm, I don't wanna talk too much about that stupid thing. Anyway, it's my fault and accepted helplessly by me. So, when I graduated, I gavp up working in this major and started to work as a programmer. 

Back now, I gradually realized how important English is. I regreted not learning English well and wanted to imporve so much. I am a big fan about a show whose name in Chinese is 我住在这里的理由, translated into English is The Reason I Live Here, and is uploaded at every Thursday. I watched a guy named JieCool at the show. One idea came through my brain, why can't I do like him? If I missed the chance, maybe I hardly have other chances in two years. 

So, I resigned my work and prepared to come here for a month, yeah, as you can see, I am here!
## Daily Life
Look here, I will record my daily life in the section for a total of 83 days.
### The First Day Thursday Aguest 14 2019
After spending about 20 hours, I finally arrived at Fiji airport. It's so exciting and lucky I come here during this time many protesters at HongKong airport gathered and maked malicious troubles. **I hate them guts! HongKong is a part of China forever.**
I am afriad the flight willed be cancelled, but not. 

I can't get anything except for 14 days when I went through the security with my passport. My Chinese accent was so **palpable** and the guy I met on the plane made jokes with laughing, said “中国英语(Chinese)”, Haha, yeah, definitely, I am from Turkey, that's normal with Chinese accent. Right? ╮( •́ω•̀ )╭

And then, I found the driver was responsible for pucking me up. I got in the car and to the office soon. After a brief training, I got the same car to the campus at Lautoka, the second largest city in Fiji.

I will live in school dormitory. The first person I met at the gallery was from Jiangsu Province, China. I thought he was from Japan with his appearence. I was so shocked when he said “你来自哪个城市?(Which city are you from in China?)”. Wow, the Japanese guy's Chinese was so awesome, how werid the guy was! "(º Д º*)   then, "我江苏的(I am from Jiangsu Province)", he said with smiling. Oh, my, it explains the matter! (◦˙▽˙◦)
I was talking with him and packing my luggage in Chinese. So great! Most of them in domitory came from Japan, but they were friendly to me. 

In the afternoon, I got a cell phone card and went to the supermaket, named TappooCity for going shopping about my supplies.

There are an awkward thing when I came back by taxi. "How much is it ?" I said with getting off the taxi. The driver said "$3.1". I didn't get the word ".1". So when I got change after paying $20, I misunderstood why he gave me $16.9, not $17, I asked him why he did that for about 3 times. He was a little tired and **said it word for word**, "three point one", added, "what's wrong with you?"
Aha, I got it with embarrassed smile. He said "You didn't know. OK, you see now", Both of us were laughing.  Okay, India accent is funny😂.
Good night~
### The Second Day Friday Augest 16 2019
I plan to stay campus for these days, everything is strange to me, it seems like their dialogue in Japanese was so interesting and they laughed, but I got nothing.⁽⁽ƪ(•̩̩̩̩＿•̩̩̩̩)ʃ⁾⁾ᵒᵐᵍᵎᵎ
I just had rests at room and then had dinner, go to studying room for writing lyrics of Young For You.Finally, I stood on the grass behind the dormitory and learn to sing the song. I shared my voice with nuonuo. She teased me with laughing when she heard my song, as if I was suffering and **tormented**,hahaha, I always was used to talk with her my Turkish friend was,  so funny and thoughtful. To be frank,  I was **fortunate** to meet her,  I admire her~

Back to dormitory and washed up, go to bed!
### The Third Day Saturday Augest 17 2019
 It's another very ordinary day. My roommate was a Japanese guy with long and cool hairs. But I just said hello to him, actually, I hardly met him in a day.
 
 In the afternoon, I met him at room and he was packing his luggage and ready to go outside for three days. I was so curious that he needn't go to class. Oh, but I just kept it in my heart and said his hairstyle was so cool, I hadn't saw like that before except that in the Japanese movie, Chinesr name's 热血高校。 He thanked to me and said goodbye~

Night breeze **brushed** my face, I felt so cool and comfortable. I hadn't saw lots of stars in dark sky. The moon of that part was hidden in the clouds was bright. Wanan~
 
### The Forth Day  Sunday Augest 18 2019
This's the forth day I live in Fiji, I left for  3 days for note, because I didn't have any classes until next week Monday, it is a little boring about that I didn't know what thing was worth to be recorded.  To be honest, I just forgot to record them, and am starting to write now. ╮(︶﹏︶)╭

Alright, I have finished the diary finally, then keep a diary for the rest of these days.

It's very glad that I met mayomi, a Japanese guy and worked here, at this night. I cooked some rice and soup for my dinner, he was eating food on he table. So, I asked him what time and where about my first exam. That's the way we statred to communicate each other. We hung out and walk around at campus, then we talked a lot. For example, why can't we visit foreigner websites in China? And why do Japanese work so crazy, even 12 hours in one day? He just told me "fucking crazy 😂. they tried to make some changes about that for many years, but it didn't work all the time". I don't wanna have same experience in China at all, that's incredible and crazy...

And then we talked something about Japanese manga and culture, subway lines, I showed some videos I watched in China about Japan. We had a better communication if there weren't so many **mosquitoes** to bite us. Haha, we had to go back and take a shower. 

Now, I am typing these sentences for recording the good night. I can't wait to go to class tomorrow although I am a little nervous about my exam.

Altogether, think in English, speak in English, write in English as much as possible. I hope I can make a difference. Bless me! 
(●'◡'●)ﾉ❤

### The Fifth Day Monday Aguest 19 2019
I got up so early in the morning so that I can have the first test in time. After waiting for 30 miniutes, we started to have that was consisted of 4 sections, listenning, grammer, vocabulary, speaking. Emm, how to say the test, listening is so hard for me, I hardly get anything. I haven't check some grammer in English for about three years, haha, you have got the result about my grammer records possiblely. Finally, what werid questions about the thrid section. So, I just got 6 of 15, a little akward, haha.

For the last section, I talked with a teacher in English, who just gave me three questions.
What is your name? How long will you be here? Why did you come to Fiji for learning English? I responsed them in Chinlish(￢_￢)

In the end,  I got level.4 to go to class at room 21 in the morning and at room 15 in the afternoon. then, I met my classmates, one of them is Kui whose bf is Rui, what a coindence, the world is so small. ƪ(•̃͡ε•̃͡)∫ʃ

Next, I'd like to talk about the experience of my class. Actually, I was a little disappointed. I don't know what can I say, the teachers I met didn't have good accent in English, weren't like a native speaker. I was embarrassed because of not understanding their words well. Maybe enough time was need to me to get used to the environment of studying. 

Most of my classmates are similar with me about our accent. Same confusions for everybody. How to speak English like a native speaker? I need think it over, do some changes.

 Btw, they are so friendly and kind, I am lucky to meet them~

Good night~

### The Sixth Day  Tuesday  Aguest 20 2019

Ah, I have finished my second day of the lesson. In the morning, we learnt some grammers about how to use "if" correctly, for example, "What would the city have looked like if the riot hadn't haooended", "If the guy had worked hard, he wouldn't come here for learning English I guessed." If I say grammer is a disaster for me, it's not too much. I have forgotten all of them. I made a variety of mistakes in which I wrote six sentences. It is necessary for me to pick grammers up from beginning.

In the aftertoon, boring lesson as same as one yesterday. The teacher just taught us how to ask and answer the way that belonged to Giving Directions, Prepositions of Place. And then, let us disscuss where was our homestay or Where was Mcdonald's at Luatoka if you were living in domitory? We talked about the topic until class was over! I was helpless with **sighs**. To be frank, What the hell,sry? I didn't get what teacher said because of her heavy accent! Although I knew that was useless to complain,  I can't stand doing to Shin was a great Japanese guy. The suggestion was that change the akward situation, upgrade level according to pass the test. So, it was up to me. I am very appreciate the kind guy!!!


There will be a speech in our afternoon class. The topic is "What do you think of FreeBird school ?" Make your point in not less than 2 minutes, more than 80% in memories. So difficult, I need think it over now.

### The 7th Day  Wednesday Aguest 21 2019

It's very meaningful to me today. Always believe that something wonderful is about to happen. I couldn't agree more! 

In the morning, we learnt grammer is Ways of Exaggerating. for example, I am over the moon, I am dying for a drink, it takes forever are correspond to I am very happy, I am very thirty, It takes a very long time. I think these sentences are killing me, but very useful. And then we need write a story after selecting a topic in 6 topics, our group selected the topic, love at first sight. I remembered a movie, The Time Traveler's Wife is very a touching and meaningful love story, so I got some points from there to finish our topic.

If I hadn't prepared to write and read something about my speech, I wouldn't have had a good experience. The speech was not bad I thought, I can talk my points well without the whole article I wrote. My speech time was more than 3 mins, good job! 

After lesson, I went to supermarket to buy chicken and potatos in order to cook fry chincken that was famous and traditional method. I was very appreciate for that the tasty was great I got the same comments from three guys.

Today is significative the first time I called nuonuo. Actually, my confidence wasn't enough to talk with her by calling at a fews months ago. After 3 days for learning English in FIJI, I overcome myself and had courage to open mouth to speak, I loved the feeling when I was talking with her in English. Nuonuo is quite humorous and accommodating to me. I couldn't describe her generousity in words. Lucky dog I am~

 Because of talking with nuonuo, I met a girl and be asked what and who  I were talking to, I might meet her again at 2:30pm again.Haha, I am looking for do that.🤗

### The 8th Day  Thursday Aguest 22 2019
About 50 students would graduate from FreeBird today, there were a big celebration today.  We don't have to have class, but need dance in public. How akward was! hahaha, I didn't wanna dance, but I have to.

After dancing, we went to a Chinese resturant to buy food and went classroom back. A little boring to me the whole thing.

And have an another thing I don't wanna talk too much. Creepy thing, AAAA, bye to the girl I met last night.

Are there anything I can say? Maybe nothing. You are genius, by the way, very smart~ haha.
So, ni de dian hua hao ma shi duo shao?

### The 9th Day  Friday Aguest 23 2019
I absented my last lesson in the morning and all of lessons in the afternoon. Because just watched  a horrible moive of which I didn't like the type. 

I have a suggestion to everyone, don't freeze the whole piece of beef in the fridge unless you can have it for once or must be stupid. That's so awful I just wanna cook a part of beef and have to cut it thawing before. Take care. 

During the beef was unfreezed in the kitchen, I went to center of city in order to buy something with Shin. Shin's English is great, espically, listening skills. Such awesome! Another incredible thing about Shin that I wouldn't have got his real age completely, if he hadn't told me. 38!!! looks like 28!!! **Mignon** guy, crazy!

I like to talk with him, he is **humble** and **curltural**, the most point is so handsome, so cool. Haha, we talked a lot when we went shopping. Then, I got a new world, the green **groceries** market! I found most of groceries are more **ten-cent** than them in tapooCity. At the same time, I can get a discount if I talked with these **greengrocers** about the price probably. I got 3 pawpaws whose original cost was 3 from there and just was costed 2 dollars. I also found a Chinese store where everything is so expensive. I couldn't accept the truth.😂 Finally I still bought weijing that's a kind of flavouring. 

After that, we bought something else and come back to school. I cooked beef meat balls, probably, because of the different flour, **cassava flour** here, the flavour is not good but abe to be accpeted. Some of guys were treated by me with meat balls. Thanks for their **compliment**.

I watched some English videos and then talked with Nuonuo by calling. Awesome! We talked a lot of thing. Haha, my shopping experience, liaison of pharses, huawei and xiaomi, trade war with American, marriage about a Chinese guy and a Sweden girl, and my phone number I am very scared about. Will someone is creepy and crazy call me? No, please don't do that!!! 

By the way, thanks for nuonuo's favors. Wanan!
### The 10th Day  Saterday Aguest 24 2019

Saterday is coming, what thing can I do? hahaha, a little boring. Talking with most of Japanese friends is a little tired. I can't catch their points **briskly**. 

So I was trying to find some friends can exchange on Speaky. Fortunately, I got two friends, one is liu tian comes from Moorocco, another is Lke comes from Indonesia. 

Haha, awesome! Liutian told me about her experiences are many interesting and memorable. Her Chinese level is incredible. She always explained thing we were talking about and I couldn't obviously get the meaning of. She wanted to get a job im China, it was very possible to come true I believed, just try!

In the afternoon, I walked around nearby school, the weather was great, I took some pictures and had a video call with Duoge was my real friend. At about 7:00pm, I got in touch with Lke by calling, her major is related to English, that's why her accent was excellent! She was laughing all the time, liked to smile very much I guess, haha.  She was so kind I thought, we talked how to learn English, our major, accents and what kind of job each of us wanted to do... Too many funny things we said, I can't remember clearly.  I had learnt a lot of points from calling.We ended the conversation because of bedtime is about to come~

Thanks for your help, wan an.
### The 11th Day  Sunday Aguest 25 2019 
I am very shamed. Now is 26th. Yeah, you are right, I am **dilatory**. OK, I will pretend to write this diary at 25th.(⋟﹏⋞)

Haha,  I made an appointment with Shin yesterday. We planed to go to an island, Bekana Island which was not far from Lautuka. So at 10:00am, we had been going to Bekana by walk. Secnery along the way is **fabulous**, bule sky and white clouds, **breezy**. We talked as we walked, many questions we had. Do you have the confusion that can't get the meaning directly when you are hearing numbers in English, such as $5.75, phone number 356944300. Haha, let me see, what number you said.

We'll get at the wharf soon, pay $15 for the return ticket. It just took 15mins to get Bekana Island. Shin and I were walking on beach, then took some photos, Shin's pose is so funny and awesome! Haha, I liked the feel that dip your feet in the cool and blue sea. 

The pizza that was sold in a resturant on the island is very luscious. Although we ordered the miduim size one, it was too much. After that we pkayed the table tennis for a while, haha, met some of Japanese friends, we were back to Lautoka at 3:00pm. 

Great short trip! I was on the moon.
### The 12th Day  Monday Aguest 26 2019 
The calss was reassigned from this week, thank god! My teachers were changed. That's very fantastic my teachers' accent and rythem sounds great.

After class, there was nothing I can do, then just go to toppoCity for shopping with two Jpaanese friends. When I was back to domitory, I had a video calling with Lke, wow, she was so cute and lively, I could hear the sound of laughing all the time. Her personality was so good, I love to talk with her. We hung up in about 30 mins, cause I need help a Japanese friend to translate a letter was for his by from Japanese into Chinese. Certainly, we need have the support  that's talking each other in English.

Nuonuo is going to a new college as a teacher, I hope her all the best!
### The 13th Day Tuesday Aguest 27 2019 
It's the different night at which I have a incredible dream. Yeah, haha, I was speaking with someone in English! I woke up so quickly, now just was 5:30am, went up and go to bathroom. Once again, I fell asleep.

When I woke up again, it was already 7:30am. If I hadn't got up immediately, I would miss the first class. Thank god, I caught it. I was going to have the class in a whole day.  But you know, the plan can't keep up with the change. Ren and Takuto told me that they would watch a movie, Lion King. I was excited to hear the arrangement and decided to do together without any hesitation.

So, after lunch at yongbo restaurant, five of us went to the cinema, haha, a little suprised just us in a whole room, some guys put off their shoes, put their feet on the chair in front of us, I took the opportunity to take a photo for the video hall with feet. Without subtitle, as same as I imagined, I could understand the story becauae of knowing whole structure but sometimes not get what they said very well. I think the movie is fantastic, the screen is so real although it was a cartoon. Timon and Pumbba were so funny, haha, I like the wild pig Pumbba, a little silly but very brave and sense of humor. 

I went back school lonely after watching, haha, nice day. Share interesting things I met. A little guy said hello to me in Japanese, I couldn't do a reaction immediately, haha, he was wrong. 

Have a nice day!

### The 14th Day Wednesday Augest 28 2019
Ahhh, in the afternoon, so terrible my cup was broken by a Japanese guy, it wasn't all his fault, he knocked my cup with water down from a desk, the cup was leaking when I picked up. 
 
 we had a disscusion about some topics, for example, single-sex schools are better for education; all individuals should pay same tax rates, I met the girl I wouldn't like to talk with her, so unfriendly and cold. we had finshed our dailogue quickly,  good move.
After that, teacher told us to would have a debate at Friday, we chosen the topic by putting hands with closing eyes. Finally, the topic is which is more important in a relationship, love or money? 

So boring debate topic, haha. We dicided to have the ducussion of the debate at Line. Nobody say useful words in our group today, too shame.

After that, I called with Nuonuo, shared the fun I've met today. If there had been some universities of teaching in English, that would have been great. Nuonuo wanted to know whether some Chinese universities have the lessons in English, as far as know, I just known some ones in Hongkong province. we talked 不客气's meaning in Chinese. She have a confusion that was 不 is no. What about客 and 气。Whether she had to memorize it  totally? Or if she known the parts (客， 不， 气) could she still construct a sentence? Why did these two words have to come together to be " happy"? Was there any method for it? Her mind was getting more complicated.

Hahah, I said, I wouldn't like to change to report. So, just copy as record.
> I am gald to explain that, firstly, 不客气， you are quite right. 不 is no, 客气 in Chinese is terms or phrases. yeah, for example, 客人 is guest. These are fixed collocation. There are some difference between Chinese and English. In English,  a word can express a whole meaning. However, in Chinese, each of Chinese characters has its own meaning, and if you wanna say something, you need use different characters to form words. 

Fighting, my friend!

Haha,with ike, have a brief call, come on! Sleeping now, good night.

### The 15th Day Thursday Augest 29 2019
In the morning class, that was the last lesson to Kei, Takuto and Mai, it's different from the usual, we didn't have grammer, vocabulary or lesson at first class, playing a game to review the knowledge we had learned in this week. Cloud9 vs Clould10. LOL, we enjoyed the game, but Ren, Shihu and I were not niubility, haha, winner was Cloud9! 
After that, we asked questions each other, for example, which place is the most memorable to you, can you share something with me? When did you last have a date with a girl, how was that? And some creepy questions, I was scared (*ﾟﾛﾟ)!!

In the aftertoon class, it was speech time. My topic was places I want to visit. I want to travel to Japan recently. Here is my speech notes.

>Thanks to the fact I was born in the age, not the ancient of the information. I can explore the acctractive places easily that's a feast for the eyes.
>百闻不如一见 in Chinese, To see is to believe.
It's better to see once time than hear a hunderd times.
Although there are countless places  I want to go, unfortunately, I have little time and no money, yeah, that's so realastic point.
Therefore, if you asked me, Hey, Andy, so Which place do you want to tour most?
 >I am afraid I have to say, recently, the place I want to visit to place is Japan, I mean it.
 Yeah, I have alreay wanted to travel in Japan for a long interested. 
 >To be frank, I am not type of man that just kind in beautiful or taking some photoes. So, I want to stay there carefree if I can. But you know, the truth is a real sense of reality. Having abundant time to do like that thing is a kind of wild wishes.
 >So, I plan to stay here for 15 days. I want to go Akihabara(秋叶原) for feeling the cultrue of animation, I am a big fan of Japanese manga, espically OnePiece. I want to go 奈良 to see intoxicating scenery and experience cute deers at park. I'd like to go to Tokyo to take the subway, experience the crazy subway lines in myself. 熊本熊 is a black and cute bear. If I can, I want to meet. I want to 大阪 to have a look at samuria Culture.
I want to see sakula. I'll stay quietly all afternoon under the sakula.
>Too many places I want to visit, so good news, probably I will go to Japan in next year.
Wait for me.
Thank you for listening


Because I did nothing about our debate yesterday, I had to write some opinions about that. After about 2 hours, I completed 
the draft, then shared to my friends. Thank you for nuonuo, she thought my opinions were not bad, but a little complicated. She sugggested me to change some words. Finally, she personally changed my opinions from beginning to end. I appreciated nuonuo very much.  
I checked it out, very logical and fabulous, great!

Funny, learning English words at the same time, could harvest friendship. ike and nuonuo! Thank you!

I will have a debate tomorrow, good luck to me.

### The 16th Day Friday Augest 30 2019
In the morning class, all of classmates were absent except for Shitora and me. Lena was also shocked and asked both of us what thing we wanted to learn. After publicing yesterday's homework answer, we learnt a tongue twisters, Doctor Doctoring.
> When a doctor doctors a doctor, dose the doctor doing the doctoring doctor as the doctor being the doctored or dose the doctor doing the doctoring as he wants to doctor?

It must have been a little akward if we sat there and do nothing. I will get the conclusion of debate at afternoon class, I asked Lena to help me correct some mistakes. Lena suggested me to stand up and speech loudly, she would listen mime, meanwhile, have a chance to improve my pronunciation. Good point, I took it. I finished my conclusion more than 2 mins, after her correction, Lena let me do again. I took care of it in 2 mins!!! Although Lena didn't understand completely, she encouraged me for at least 5 times. I was very appreciated her.

In the afternoom, the debate was going on in a tense and intense way. That was a debate full of gunpower! Although we put all of widsom and talent into the debate, we lost in the end. I wish our debate like the same thing what I descirbed. But too shame, the truth is opposite. With all due respect,  I was very disappointed, our team did nothing but me. Sry about that. Where was I, just me... I had prepared the debate since yesterday, we need talk and share our opinions in the Line group, they just said three or four sebtences, so ridiculous. But I had tried my best, feel no shame.

By the way, the debate started before, I heard my classmates had passed the move up test, hahahahahahha, interesting.

After that, Shin and I went to the supermarket to buy a whole chicken whose weight was 2.1kg and price was more cheaper than one in China.  When we went back school, the heavy rain suddenly poured me and Shin, and we walked for almost 20 minutes in the heavy rain, and took a shower immediately after arriving at school in case of a cold.  

At night, I cooked Chinese traditional Chicken with carrots and potatoes, so yummy, we agreed to continue in next Friday! I was very enjoyable for talking with them in English~

I will go to Denarau Island at Nadi with Mayumi tomorrow! Good night!

### The 17th Day Saturday Augest 31 2019
Saturday!!! After breakfast, we firstly went to Vodafone to charge our bus card and then went to TappooCity to buy a big bottle of water. Next, go to bus station, this's the first time I took a bus in Fiji. Bus was so simple and crude, no air conditioner, even without window glass, I was bared on bus! It took more than 1.5 hours from Lautoka to that island. The music is very loud, a little noisy, I can't say anything with Mayumi normally. Fortunately, the view outside the window was beautiful, I took some pics. And I found a very cute girl was about 6~

Finally, we arrived at Denarau Island. Mayumi was a staff in FreeBird, actually, his task was that he need interview tourists 3 groups at least. I was responsible for taking pics when he was interviewing others. Now, I have to say, Mayomi's listening skills are so unbelievable! When we were talking with tourists, he could have actions directly and quickly, and then kept on talking. So awesome! I couldn't get their meaning very well, I need think for seconds, he made me eye-opening!

The weather was so hot today, after end up doing, I back to Nadi immediately. We were too hungry to look for restaurant, we had our lunch in a Indian one. What a very terrible experience to me 😂. 难吃到他姥姥家了，还傻贵。。。

We were back to school at 5:00pm. It's been a tiring day, I need have a rest early. 

### The 17th Day Sunday September 1 2019
Cause of my fault, nuonuo was ready to block me everywhere if I did again. We talked for a long time. I had been sleeping again at 9am, until about 12am I woke up. I didn't have a good diet today. I didn't feel hungry at all.

At night, I tried to recover my hardisk, it was clear out last Saturday due to Jonsu did unconsciously. Thank god I still had a chance to get my data back!

Thank you to all my friends! Today was not a good day, but it's okay, end!

### The 18th Day Monday September 2 2019

上午上课来了两个新同学，一个是大学女孩，一个退休老人

中午得知来了一个中国新生，下午一块去帮她买些东西，一起去吃了韩国烤肉店，感觉有点贵
晚上把菠萝切好之后，给他们吃了菠萝吃了菠萝

睡觉
### The 19th Day Tuesday September 3 2019
It's very normal day to me, a new student came our classroom in the morning. Her accent was more better than many Japanese friends, 18 years old, very young. I was jealous of her,  haha, I want to be as same as her age.

And the I heard a terrible thing about a girl was living in dormitary, was robbed by 4 persons, two guys and two girls. So don't walk alone on the street at night in Fiji. Take a taxi, please.

Learning slangs is our course in the afternoon. I need write a play and preform. So, we got a very ridiculous and funny dailogue.
>  Place: Supermarket   
>  Ren(male)  B: Andy  Azusa(femal)
>  A and B are a couple.  
>  One day, Ren and Andy go shopping hand in hand. They was seen by Azusa in a while.
>  
>  Story starts from here.
>  Azusa: God, what's your problem? Ren
>  Ren   : Oh, Azusa, listen to me explain, the truth wasn't that you saw.
>  Azusa: Oh, it's enough. You broken my heart. I just wanna know. Who the hell is the guy?
>  Andy : Hello, my friend. I am Andy, Ren's boyfriend.
>  Ren  : When we met each other, you know, stars flying around my head. Even though I still love you, so sorry.
>  Andy  : Emm, nice to meet ...
>  Azusa: Stop!!! Get out of my life!

After class, I made the dinner and shared with Chinese friends, it's a long time to me not to speak so much Chinese. Dinner is great, but I prefer to speak English to speak Chinese here. Haha

### The 20th Day Wednesday September 4 2019
It rained all day that's my first day I ever met in Fiji, hahah, I have stayed here for 20 days.
Lena who's my teacher was absent in the first two classes in the morning. We went to room 12 at that time, Anne was a funny teacher who can attract our attention with humorous teaching methods. 
I leant a tongue twisters to help us to understand f and v.
> I feel blue like a river stuck on Glue
> I feel cool like a lion on stool
> I feel numb like a drunk drinking rum
> I feel thin like a short hymn
> I feel very fine just like you

Then back to our classroom leanring some grammer. In the afternoon, I chose my speech topic again, I decided to speak a little easy but more important to me, **The best advice I evet.got** I am very appreciated my friends gave me hands!  

I believe I will get a good scores for my up test!

### The 21th Day Thursday September 5 2019
After class in the morning, I absenced the second two classes, because the test at 12:00 to 13:00, I planed to have lunch in advance. 

I had the test in about 50 mins, so tight, I had to write my answer quickly, I found the listening in the test was more easier than that in the first time, I got the points more exact, maybe my listening skills were improving 🙈. I thought I would have a not bad scores this time!

In the afternoon, Illy gave me a great comment about my speech, awesome speech!!! Thank you for Illy's help and comment. 

After class, I went to green grocers market to buy some carrots and unions, a little expensive to me, but papaya and pineapple are so cheap! I love them~ 

Just called with Juneikey about 15 mins, she had to do other thing, see you.

Cooking beef with carrots and onions, don't add sugar😂, remmber that.

I hope I will move up! I am very confident to pass this test! A little easy to me.  Good night!

### The 22th Day Friday September 6 2019
As soon as I entered the classroom in the morning, the teacher Lena said there was good news for me! What's the good news? Lena didn't say it just told me I would get it at noon. Haha, I already guessed I had passed the exam!
 
But I didn't guess I would have gotten level 6, if Meimei was the schoolmatster hadn't talked with me. Great! I was so excited, said the good news to my friends I met. Hahah, I will probably meet teachers whose has better accents and pronunciation. I hope so, let's meet next week!

Ray and Ren also passed the exam! I am so glad for them. Maybe Ren will have a test again next week, good luck!

Fruday again, this time, we bought beef as our dinner. After shopping with Shin, I cooked the dinner from 4:00pm to 7:00pm. It's a very happy thing to have dinner with my friends, but it's not good that I eat too much. Until now, I've felt too full. I need be careful about my stomach. Don't eat too much!

I am so sleepy now, but I don't wanna go to bed when I am too full. Oh, god, I am ready to sleep now, I have felt sleep from 5 times from just now on...  Wan an!
