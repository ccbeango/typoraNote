# FreeBird in Fiji
Hi, everybody. In this blog I just wanna record my imteresting things, share my thoughts in life and learning spoken English experience.
By the way, my English is suck, I don't have enough vocabulary, good grammer and **logical capability**, so, It's possible this blog is mess and doesn't have good points you worth reading, think it over before starting, lol.
OK, let's start!

## Why did I choose and come here?

Do you know? I have graduated from college about 3 years. Yeah, so fast and quietly, right? My major is Packaging Engineering that is a long story why I choosed and studied during my **undergraduate** year. I don't like the major at all. Emm, I don't wanna talk too much about that stupid thing. Anyway, it's my fault and accepted helplessly by me. So, when I graduated, I gavp up working in this major and started to work as a programmer. 

Back now, I gradually realized how important English is. I regreted not learning English well and wanted to imporve so much. I am a big fan about a show whose name in Chinese is 我住在这里的理由, translated into English is The Reason I Live Here, and is uploaded at every Thursday. I watched a guy named JieCool at the show. One idea came through my brain, why can't I do like him? If I missed the chance, maybe I hardly have other chances in two years. So, I resigned my work and prepared to come here for a month, yeah, as you can see, I am here!
## Daily Life
Look here, I will record my daily life in the section for a total of 83 days.
### The First Day Thursday Aguest 14 2019
After spending about 20 hours, I finally arrived at Fiji airport. It's so exciting and lucky I come here during this time many protesters at HongKong airport gathered and maked malicious troubles. **I hate them guts! HongKong is a part of China forever.**
I am afriad the flight willed be cancelled, but not. 
I can't get anything except for 14 days when I went through the security with my passport. My Chinese accent was so **palpable** and the guy I met on the plane made jokes with laughing, said “中国英语(Chinese)”, Haha, yeah, definitely, I am from Turkey, that's normal with Chinese accent. Right? ╮( •́ω•̀ )╭
And then, I found the driver was responsible for pucking me up. I got in the car and to the office soon. After a brief training, I got the same car to the campus at Lautoka, the second largest city in Fiji.
I will live in school dormitory. The first person I met at the gallery was from Jiangsu Province, China. I thought he was from Japan with his appearence. I was so shocked when he said “你来自哪个城市?(Which city are you from in China?)”. Wow, the Japanese guy's Chinese was so awesome, how werid the guy was! "(º Д º*)   then, "我江苏的(I am from Jiangsu Province)", he said with smiling. Oh, my, it explains the matter! (◦˙▽˙◦)
I was talking with him and packing my luggage in Chinese. So great! 
Most of them in domitory came from Japan, but they were friendly to me. In the afternoon, I got a cell phone card and went to the supermaket, named TappooCity for going shopping about my supplies.
There are an awkward thing when I came back by taxi. "How much is it ?" I said with getting off the taxi. The driver said "$3.1". I didn't get the word ".1". So when I got change after paying $20, I misunderstood why he gave me $16.9, not $17, I asked him why he did that for about 3 times. He was a little tired and **said it word for word**, "three point one", added, "what's wrong with you?"
Aha, I got it with embarrassed smile. He said "You didn't know. OK, you see now", Both of us were laughing.  Okay, India accent is funny😂.
Good night~
### The Second Day Friday Augest 16 2019

This's the forth day I live in Fiji, I left for  3 days for note, because I didn't have any classes until next week Monday, it is a little boring about that I didn't know what thing was worth to be recorded.  To be honest, I just forgot to record them, and am starting to write now. ╮(︶﹏︶)╭
