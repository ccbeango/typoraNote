# FreeBird in Fiji
Hi, everybody. In this blog I just wanna record my imteresting things, share my thoughts in life and learning spoken English experience.

By the way, my English is suck, I don't have enough vocabulary, good grammer and **logical capability**, so, It's possible this blog is mess and doesn't have good points you worth reading, think it over before starting, lol. Maybe with the process of my studying, it will be more and more better, I hope so~

OK, let's start!

## Why did I choose and come here?

Do you know? I have graduated from college about 3 years. Yeah, so fast and quietly, right? My major is Packaging Engineering that is a long story why I choosed and studied during my **undergraduate** year. I don't like the major at all. Emm, I don't wanna talk too much about that stupid thing. Anyway, it's my fault and accepted helplessly by me. So, when I graduated, I gavp up working in this major and started to work as a programmer. 

Back now, I gradually realized how important English is. I regreted not learning English well and wanted to imporve so much. I am a big fan about a show whose name in Chinese is 我住在这里的理由, translated into English is The Reason I Live Here, and is uploaded at every Thursday. I watched a guy named JieCool at the show. One idea came through my brain, why can't I do like him? If I missed the chance, maybe I hardly have other chances in two years. 

So, I resigned my work and prepared to come here for a month, yeah, as you can see, I am here!
## Daily Life
Look here, I will record my daily life in the section for a total of 83 days.
### The First Day Thursday Aguest 14 2019
After spending about 20 hours, I finally arrived at Fiji airport. It's so exciting and lucky I come here during this time many protesters at HongKong airport gathered and maked malicious troubles. **I hate them guts! HongKong is a part of China forever.**
I am afriad the flight willed be cancelled, but not. 

I can't get anything except for 14 days when I went through the security with my passport. My Chinese accent was so **palpable** and the guy I met on the plane made jokes with laughing, said “中国英语(Chinese)”, Haha, yeah, definitely, I am from Turkey, that's normal with Chinese accent. Right? ╮( •́ω•̀ )╭

And then, I found the driver was responsible for pucking me up. I got in the car and to the office soon. After a brief training, I got the same car to the campus at Lautoka, the second largest city in Fiji.

I will live in school dormitory. The first person I met at the gallery was from Jiangsu Province, China. I thought he was from Japan with his appearence. I was so shocked when he said “你来自哪个城市?(Which city are you from in China?)”. Wow, the Japanese guy's Chinese was so awesome, how werid the guy was! "(º Д º*)   then, "我江苏的(I am from Jiangsu Province)", he said with smiling. Oh, my, it explains the matter! (◦˙▽˙◦)
I was talking with him and packing my luggage in Chinese. So great! Most of them in domitory came from Japan, but they were friendly to me. 

In the afternoon, I got a cell phone card and went to the supermaket, named TappooCity for going shopping about my supplies.

There are an awkward thing when I came back by taxi. "How much is it ?" I said with getting off the taxi. The driver said "$3.1". I didn't get the word ".1". So when I got change after paying $20, I misunderstood why he gave me $16.9, not $17, I asked him why he did that for about 3 times. He was a little tired and **said it word for word**, "three point one", added, "what's wrong with you?"
Aha, I got it with embarrassed smile. He said "You didn't know. OK, you see now", Both of us were laughing.  Okay, India accent is funny😂.
Good night~
### The Second Day Friday Augest 16 2019
I plan to stay campus for these days, everything is strange to me, it seems like their dialogue in Japanese was so interesting and they laughed, but I got nothing.⁽⁽ƪ(•̩̩̩̩＿•̩̩̩̩)ʃ⁾⁾ᵒᵐᵍᵎᵎ
I just had rests at room and then had dinner, go to studying room for writing lyrics of Young For You.Finally, I stood on the grass behind the dormitory and learn to sing the song. I shared my voice with nuonuo. She teased me with laughing when she heard my song, as if I was suffering and **tormented**,hahaha, I always was used to talk with her my Turkish friend was,  so funny and thoughtful. To be frank,  I was **fortunate** to meet her,  I admire her~

Back to dormitory and washed up, go to bed!
### The Third Day Saturday Augest 17 2019
 It's another very ordinary day. My roommate was a Japanese guy with long and cool hairs. But I just said hello to him, actually, I hardly met him in a day.
 
 In the afternoon, I met him at room and he was packing his luggage and ready to go outside for three days. I was so curious that he needn't go to class. Oh, but I just kept it in my heart and said his hairstyle was so cool, I hadn't saw like that before except that in the Japanese movie, Chinesr name's 热血高校。 He thanked to me and said goodbye~

Night breeze **brushed** my face, I felt so cool and comfortable. I hadn't saw lots of stars in dark sky. The moon of that part was hidden in the clouds was bright. Wanan~
 
### The Forth Day  Sunday Augest 18 2019
This's the forth day I live in Fiji, I left for  3 days for note, because I didn't have any classes until next week Monday, it is a little boring about that I didn't know what thing was worth to be recorded.  To be honest, I just forgot to record them, and am starting to write now. ╮(︶﹏︶)╭

Alright, I have finished the diary finally, then keep a diary for the rest of these days.

It's very glad that I met mayomi, a Japanese guy and worked here, at this night. I cooked some rice and soup for my dinner, he was eating food on he table. So, I asked him what time and where about my first exam. That's the way we statred to communicate each other. We hung out and walk around at campus, then we talked a lot. For example, why can't we visit foreigner websites in China? And why do Japanese work so crazy, even 12 hours in one day? He just told me "fucking crazy 😂. they tried to make some changes about that for many years, but it didn't work all the time". I don't wanna have same experience in China at all, that's incredible and crazy...

And then we talked something about Japanese manga and culture, subway lines, I showed some videos I watched in China about Japan. We had a better communication if there weren't so many **mosquitoes** to bite us. Haha, we had to go back and take a shower. 

Now, I am typing these sentences for recording the good night. I can't wait to go to class tomorrow although I am a little nervous about my exam.

Altogether, think in English, speak in English, write in English as much as possible. I hope I can make a difference. Bless me! 
(●'◡'●)ﾉ❤

### The Fifth Day Monday Aguest 19 2019
I got up so early in the morning so that I can have the first test in time. After waiting for 30 miniutes, we started to have that was consisted of 4 sections, listenning, grammer, vocabulary, speaking. Emm, how to say the test, listening is so hard for me, I hardly get anything. I haven't check some grammer in English for about three years, haha, you have got the result about my grammer records possiblely. Finally, what werid questions about the thrid section. So, I just got 6 of 15, a little akward, haha.

For the last section, I talked with a teacher in English, who just gave me three questions.
What is your name? How long will you be here? Why did you come to Fiji for learning English? I responsed them in Chinlish(￢_￢)

In the end,  I got level.4 to go to class at room 21 in the morning and at room 15 in the afternoon. then, I met my classmates, one of them is Kui whose bf is Rui, what a coindence, the world is so small. ƪ(•̃͡ε•̃͡)∫ʃ

Next, I'd like to talk about the experience of my class. Actually, I was a little disappointed. I don't know what can I say, the teachers I met didn't have good accent in English, weren't like a native speaker. I was embarrassed because of not understanding their words well. Maybe enough time was need to me to get used to the environment of studying. 

Most of my classmates are similar with me about our accent. Same confusions for everybody. How to speak English like a native speaker? I need think it over, do some changes.

 Btw, they are so friendly and kind, I am lucky to meet them~

Good night~

### The Sixth Day  Tuesday  Aguest 20 2019

Ah, I have finished my second day of the lesson. In the morning, we learnt some grammers about how to use "if" correctly, for example, "What would the city have looked like if the riot hadn't haooended", "If the guy had worked hard, he wouldn't come here for learning English I guessed." If I say grammer is a disaster for me, it's not too much. I have forgotten all of them. I made a variety of mistakes in which I wrote six sentences. It is necessary for me to pick grammers up from beginning.

In the aftertoon, boring lesson as same as one yesterday. The teacher just taught us how to ask and answer the way that belonged to Giving Directions, Prepositions of Place. And then, let us disscuss where was our homestay or Where was Mcdonald's at Luatoka if you were living in domitory? We talked about the topic until class was over! I was helpless with **sighs**. To be frank, What the hell,sry? I didn't get what teacher said because of her heavy accent! Although I knew that was useless to complain,  I can't stand doing to Shin was a great Japanese guy. The suggestion was that change the akward situation, upgrade level according to pass the test. So, it was up to me. I am very appreciate the kind guy!!!


There will be a speech in our afternoon class. The topic is "What do you think of FreeBird school ?" Make your point in not less than 2 minutes, more than 80% in memories. So difficult, I need think it over now.

### The 7th Day  Wednesday Aguest 21 2019

It's very meaningful to me today. Always believe that something wonderful is about to happen. I couldn't agree more! 

In the morning, we learnt grammer is Ways of Exaggerating. for example, I am over the moon, I am dying for a drink, it takes forever are correspond to I am very happy, I am very thirty, It takes a very long time. I think these sentences are killing me, but very useful. And then we need write a story after selecting a topic in 6 topics, our group selected the topic, love at first sight. I remembered a movie, The Time Traveler's Wife is very a touching and meaningful love story, so I got some points from there to finish our topic.

If I hadn't prepared to write and read something about my speech, I wouldn't have had a good experience. The speech was not bad I thought, I can talk my points well without the whole article I wrote. My speech time was more than 3 mins, good job! 

After lesson, I went to supermarket to buy chicken and potatos in order to cook fry chincken that was famous and traditional method. I was very appreciate for that the tasty was great I got the same comments from three guys.

Today is significative the first time I called nuonuo. Actually, my confidence wasn't enough to talk with her by calling at a fews months ago. After 3 days for learning English in FIJI, I overcome myself and had courage to open mouth to speak, I loved the feeling when I was talking with her in English. Nuonuo is quite humorous and accommodating to me. I couldn't describe her generousity in words. Lucky dog I am~

 Because of talking with nuonuo, I met a girl and be asked what and who  I were talking to, I might meet her again at 2:30pm again.Haha, I am looking for do that.🤗

### The 8th Day  Thursday Aguest 22 2019
About 50 students would graduate from FreeBird today, there were a big celebration today.  We don't have to have class, but need dance in public. How akward was! hahaha, I didn't wanna dance, but I have to.

After dancing, we went to a Chinese resturant to buy food and went classroom back. A little boring to me the whole thing.

And have an another thing I don't wanna talk too much. Creepy thing, AAAA, bye to the girl I met last night.

Are there anything I can say? Maybe nothing. You are genius, by the way, very smart~ haha.
So, ni de dian hua hao ma shi duo shao?

### The 9th Day  Friday Aguest 23 2019
I absented my last lesson in the morning and all of lessons in the afternoon. Because just watched  a horrible moive of which I didn't like the type. 

I have a suggestion to everyone, don't freeze the whole piece of beef in the fridge unless you can have it for once or must be stupid. That's so awful I just wanna cook a part of beef and have to cut it thawing before. Take care. 

During the beef was unfreezed in the kitchen, I went to center of city in order to buy something with Shin. Shin's English is great, espically, listening skills. Such awesome! Another incredible thing about Shin that I wouldn't have got his real age completely, if he hadn't told me. 38!!! looks like 28!!! **Mignon** guy, crazy!

I like to talk with him, he is **humble** and **curltural**, the most point is so handsome, so cool. Haha, we talked a lot when we went shopping. Then, I got a new world, the green **groceries** market! I found most of groceries are more **ten-cent** than them in tapooCity. At the same time, I can get a discount if I talked with these **greengrocers** about the price probably. I got 3 pawpaws whose original cost was 3 from there and just was costed 2 dollars. I also found a Chinese store where everything is so expensive. I couldn't accept the truth.😂 Finally I still bought weijing that's a kind of flavouring. 

After that, we bought something else and come back to school. I cooked beef meat balls, probably, because of the different flour, **cassava flour** here, the flavour is not good but abe to be accpeted. Some of guys were treated by me with meat balls. Thanks for their **compliment**.

I watched some English videos and then talked with Nuonuo by calling. Awesome! We talked a lot of thing. Haha, my shopping experience, liaison of pharses, huawei and xiaomi, trade war with American, marriage about a Chinese guy and a Sweden girl, and my phone number I am very scared about. Will someone is creepy and crazy call me? No, please don't do that!!! 

By the way, thanks for nuonuo's favors. Wanan!
