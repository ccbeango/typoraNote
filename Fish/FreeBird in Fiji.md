# FreeBird in Fiji
Hi, everybody. In this blog I just wanna record my imteresting things, share my thoughts in life and learning spoken English experience.

By the way, my English is suck, I don't have enough vocabulary, good grammer and **logical capability**, so, It's possible this blog is mess and doesn't have good points you worth reading, think it over before starting, lol. Maybe with the process of my studying, it will be more and more better, I hope so~

OK, let's start!

## Why did I choose and come here?

Do you know? I have graduated from college about 3 years. Yeah, so fast and quietly, right? My major is Packaging Engineering that is a long story why I choosed and studied during my **undergraduate** year. I don't like the major at all. Emm, I don't wanna talk too much about that stupid thing. Anyway, it's my fault and accepted helplessly by me. So, when I graduated, I gavp up working in this major and started to work as a programmer. 

Back now, I gradually realized how important English is. I regreted not learning English well and wanted to imporve so much. I am a big fan about a show whose name in Chinese is 我住在这里的理由, translated into English is The Reason I Live Here, and is uploaded at every Thursday. I watched a guy named JieCool at the show. One idea came through my brain, why can't I do like him? If I missed the chance, maybe I hardly have other chances in two years. 

So, I resigned my work and prepared to come here for a month, yeah, as you can see, I am here!
## Daily Life
Look here, I will record my daily life in the section for a total of 83 days.
### The First Day Thursday Aguest 14 2019
After spending about 20 hours, I finally arrived at Fiji airport. It's so exciting and lucky I come here during this time many protesters at HongKong airport gathered and maked malicious troubles. **I hate them guts! HongKong is a part of China forever.**
I am afriad the flight willed be cancelled, but not. 

I can't get anything except for 14 days when I went through the security with my passport. My Chinese accent was so **palpable** and the guy I met on the plane made jokes with laughing, said “中国英语(Chinese)”, Haha, yeah, definitely, I am from Turkey, that's normal with Chinese accent. Right? ╮( •́ω•̀ )╭

And then, I found the driver was responsible for pucking me up. I got in the car and to the office soon. After a brief training, I got the same car to the campus at Lautoka, the second largest city in Fiji.

I will live in school dormitory. The first person I met at the gallery was from Jiangsu Province, China. I thought he was from Japan with his appearence. I was so shocked when he said “你来自哪个城市?(Which city are you from in China?)”. Wow, the Japanese guy's Chinese was so awesome, how werid the guy was! "(º Д º*)   then, "我江苏的(I am from Jiangsu Province)", he said with smiling. Oh, my, it explains the matter! (◦˙▽˙◦)
I was talking with him and packing my luggage in Chinese. So great! Most of them in domitory came from Japan, but they were friendly to me. 

In the afternoon, I got a cell phone card and went to the supermaket, named TappooCity for going shopping about my supplies.

There are an awkward thing when I came back by taxi. "How much is it ?" I said with getting off the taxi. The driver said "$3.1". I didn't get the word ".1". So when I got change after paying $20, I misunderstood why he gave me $16.9, not $17, I asked him why he did that for about 3 times. He was a little tired and **said it word for word**, "three point one", added, "what's wrong with you?"
Aha, I got it with embarrassed smile. He said "You didn't know. OK, you see now", Both of us were laughing.  Okay, India accent is funny😂.
Good night~
### The Second Day Friday Augest 16 2019
I plan to stay campus for these days, everything is strange to me, it seems like their dialogue in Japanese was so interesting and they laughed, but I got nothing.⁽⁽ƪ(•̩̩̩̩＿•̩̩̩̩)ʃ⁾⁾ᵒᵐᵍᵎᵎ
I just had rests at room and then had dinner, go to studying room for writing lyrics of Young For You.Finally, I stood on the grass behind the dormitory and learn to sing the song. I shared my voice with nuonuo. She teased me with laughing when she heard my song, as if I was suffering and **tormented**,hahaha, I always was used to talk with her my Turkish friend was,  so funny and thoughtful. To be frank,  I was **fortunate** to meet her,  I admire her~

Back to dormitory and washed up, go to bed!
### The Third Day Saturday Augest 17 2019
 It's another very ordinary day. My roommate was a Japanese guy with long and cool hairs. But I just said hello to him, actually, I hardly met him in a day.
 
 In the afternoon, I met him at room and he was packing his luggage and ready to go outside for three days. I was so curious that he needn't go to class. Oh, but I just kept it in my heart and said his hairstyle was so cool, I hadn't saw like that before except that in the Japanese movie, Chinesr name's 热血高校。 He thanked to me and said goodbye~

Night breeze **brushed** my face, I felt so cool and comfortable. I hadn't saw lots of stars in dark sky. The moon of that part was hidden in the clouds was bright. Wanan~
 
### The Forth Day  Sunday Augest 18 2019
This's the forth day I live in Fiji, I left for  3 days for note, because I didn't have any classes until next week Monday, it is a little boring about that I didn't know what thing was worth to be recorded.  To be honest, I just forgot to record them, and am starting to write now. ╮(︶﹏︶)╭

Alright, I have finished the diary finally, then keep a diary for the rest of these days.

It's very glad that I met mayomi, a Japanese guy and worked here, at this night. I cooked some rice and soup for my dinner, he was eating food on he table. So, I asked him what time and where about my first exam. That's the way we statred to communicate each other. We hung out and walk around at campus, then we talked a lot. For example, why can't we visit foreigner websites in China? And why do Japanese work so crazy, even 12 hours in one day? He just told me "fucking crazy 😂. they tried to make some changes about that for many years, but it didn't work all the time". I don't wanna have same experience in China at all, that's incredible and crazy...

And then we talked something about Japanese manga and culture, subway lines, I showed some videos I watched in China about Japan. We had a better communication if there weren't so many **mosquitoes** to bite us. Haha, we had to go back and take a shower. 

Now, I am typing these sentences for recording the good night. I can't wait to go to class tomorrow although I am a little nervous about my exam.

Altogether, think in English, speak in English, write in English as much as possible. I hope I can make a difference. Bless me! 
(●'◡'●)ﾉ❤

### The Fifth Day Monday Aguest 19 2019
I got up so early in the morning so that I can have the first test in time. After waiting for 30 miniutes, we started to have that was consisted of 4 sections, listenning, grammer, vocabulary, speaking. Emm, how to say the test, listening is so hard for me, I hardly get anything. I haven't check some grammer in English for about three years, haha, you have got the result about my grammer records possiblely. Finally, what werid questions about the thrid section. So, I just got 6 of 15, a little akward, haha.

For the last section, I talked with a teacher in English, who just gave me three questions.
What is your name? How long will you be here? Why did you come to Fiji for learning English? I responsed them in Chinlish(￢_￢)

In the end,  I got level.4 to go to class at room 21 in the morning and at room 15 in the afternoon. then, I met my classmates, one of them is Kui whose bf is Rui, what a coindence, the world is so small. ƪ(•̃͡ε•̃͡)∫ʃ

Next, I'd like to talk about the experience of my class. Actually, I was a little disappointed. I don't know what can I say, the teachers I met didn't have good accent in English, weren't like a native speaker. I was embarrassed because of not understanding their words well. Maybe enough time was need to me to get used to the environment of studying. 

Most of my classmates are similar with me about our accent. Same confusions for everybody. How to speak English like a native speaker? I need think it over, do some changes.

 Btw, they are so friendly and kind, I am lucky to meet them~

Good night~

### The Sixth Day  Tuesday  Aguest 20 2019

Ah, I have finished my second day of the lesson. In the morning, we learnt some grammers about how to use "if" correctly, for example, "What would the city have looked like if the riot hadn't haooended", "If the guy had worked hard, he wouldn't come here for learning English I guessed." If I say grammer is a disaster for me, it's not too much. I have forgotten all of them. I made a variety of mistakes in which I wrote six sentences. It is necessary for me to pick grammers up from beginning.

In the aftertoon, boring lesson as same as one yesterday. The teacher just taught us how to ask and answer the way that belonged to Giving Directions, Prepositions of Place. And then, let us disscuss where was our homestay or Where was Mcdonald's at Luatoka if you were living in domitory? We talked about the topic until class was over! I was helpless with **sighs**. To be frank, What the hell,sry? I didn't get what teacher said because of her heavy accent! Although I knew that was useless to complain,  I can't stand doing to Shin was a great Japanese guy. The suggestion was that change the akward situation, upgrade level according to pass the test. So, it was up to me. I am very appreciate the kind guy!!!


There will be a speech in our afternoon class. The topic is "What do you think of FreeBird school ?" Make your point in not less than 2 minutes, more than 80% in memories. So difficult, I need think it over now.

hello, nuonuo
